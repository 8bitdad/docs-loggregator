You can increase the Doppler internal buffer size by increasing the `doppler.message_drain_buffer_size` property from its default value of `100` in your Cloud Foundry BOSH deployment manifest.

### Add additional Doppler server instances

You can increase the number of Doppler servers by increasing the `instances` property for the `doppler_z1` and `doppler_z2` jobs in your Cloud Foundry BOSH deployment manifest.

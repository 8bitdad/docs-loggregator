<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides an overview of logging and metrics in Cloud Foundry (CF). It inlcudes information about logs and metrics sources and transport systems. It also lists products for viewing logs and metrics.

## <a id="sources"></a>Sources of Logs and Metrics

There are two sources of CF logs and metrics: 

 - CF platform components, such as a Diego Cell, MySQL Server, or Cloud Controller
 - Apps deployed on CF

The table below describes the data included in logs and metrics from each source.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th width="20%">Source</th>
		<th width="40%">Logs Data</th>
		<th>Metrics Data</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Platform components
		</td>
		<td>
			Logs from CF components	
		</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Platform metrics from CF components. For example, Cell Capacity Remaining.</li>
				<li>VM health metrics from BOSH *</li>
				<li>Metrics for any service tile that self-publishes to the Loggregator Firehose. For example, Redis, MySQL, and Healthwatch.</li>
			</ul>	
		</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Apps
		</td>
		<td>
			Logs from apps ** 
		</td>		
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li>App container metrics. For example, CPU, memory, and disk usage.</li>
				<li>Custom metrics ***</li>
				<li>Metrics for any service tile that self-publishes to the Loggregator Firehose. For example, Redis, MySQL, and Healthwatch.</li>
			</ul>
		</td>	
	</tr>	
</table>

\* For more information about using the BOSH Health Monitor to collect health metrics on VMs, see [Configuring a Monitoring System](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/metrics.html#bosh-cf).

** For more information about application logging, see [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).

*** For more information about configuring an application to stream custom metrics to Loggregator, see [Metrics Forwarder for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/metrics-forwarder/).

## <a id="transport"></a>Transport Systems for Logs and Metrics

The following transport systems deliver logs and metrics from their source to an observability product for viewing:

- **Loggregator**: Loggregator is the transport system for both logs and metrics on apps deployed on CF as well as metrics on CF platform components. For more information about the Loggregator system, including Loggregator architecture and components, see [Overview of the Loggregator System](./architecture.html).
- **rsyslogd on CF component VMs**: rsyslogd is the transport system for CF component logs. Users can configure rsyslogd to transport component logs to a third-party syslog server.

The table below lists the transport system for logs and metrics on CF platform components and apps.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th width="20%">Source</th>
		<th width="40%">Logs Transport System</th>
		<th>Metrics Transport System</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Platform components
		</td>
		<td>
			rsyslogd on CF component VMs		
		</td>
		<td>
			Loggregator	
		</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Apps
		</td>
		<td>
			Loggregator 
		</td>		
		<td>
			Loggregator
		</td>	
	</tr>	
</table>

## <a id="viewing"></a> Viewing Logs and Metrics

The table below lists the products and tools for viewing CF logs and metrics.
